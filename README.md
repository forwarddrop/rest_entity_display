# rest_entity_display

## Installation

As every other Drupal module.

## Usage

Configure your rest.settings.yml to include a "rest_view_entity_display" resource.
On top of that you need to setup the permissions to use this resource.

Once configured, you can access an individual rendered viewmode on ```/rest_entity_view_display/{entity_type_id}/{id}/{view_mode}```
